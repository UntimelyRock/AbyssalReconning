Abyssal reconning is a game I have recently started working on in Godot 4.x as a way of learning how the game engine works.
It will be a top down survival game set in a post apocolyptic sci-fi world. The gameplay loop will consist of flying a ship between broken down space ships and space stations and fighting to survive against the hazards of those ships and stations,
these will be natural hazards such as rapid decompression from failing hulls, and fuel and coolant leaks, to hostile creatures trying to hunt you down.
I hope to make it multi-player so you can play with a team of other people. The instperation for this are from the game duskers, Sas 4 zombie assult, and lethal company.
